  If this file is opened in VS, there will be messages below:
    Could not find schema information for the attribute 'version'
    Could not find schema information for the element 'supportedRuntime'.
 
  It seems VS always use .NET 3.5's XSD to validate the schema 
  because the project's target is .NET 3.5, where
  those tags are not valid. This is a VS bug.
  
  The configuration is to make the application load CLR 2.0. So that
  we can use it to do sanity testing against CLR 2.0.
