## Splunk SDK for C# Example: SharePoint Web Part

This example uses the GridView control&mdash;part of the .NET Framework&mdash;to 
display a table based on the results of a Splunk search. The example is built 
using Visual Studio as a Visual Web part for SharePoint.

To run this example, install SharePoint 2010 Foundation or Server. Deploy the 
project using the **BUILD** menu, or press F5 to debug. Edit a page and insert 
the Web part, which is under the "Custom" category. Be aware that this example
relies on the .splunkrc file.

If you are running Windows 7 or Windows Vista, refer to "[Setting Up the 
Development Environment for SharePoint 2010 on Windows Vista, Windows 7, and 
Windows Server 
2008](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee554869%28v=office.14%29.aspx)"
to install SharePoint.
