// Summary of class relationships and control flow
// 
// All result readers support both the Iterator interface and
// getNextEvent method. They share the same underlying implementation
// of getNextElement(). The iterator interface is supported through
// the base class, StreamIterableBase (which is also used by
// multi result readers).
// 
// Some result readers support multiple result sets in the input stream.
// A result set can be skipped, or combined with the
// previous result set with newer events returned through the same
// iterator used for the older events even through they are in different result
// sets.
// 
// Such a result reader is also used by a multi result reader which
// returns an iterator over the result sets, with one result set returned
// in one iteration, as SearchResults. SearchResults is an interface consisting
// of getters of preview flag, field name list, and an iterator over events.
// Unlike ResultReader, SearchResults does not have a close method. Only the
// containing multi reader needs to be closed by an application.
