This is a placeholder for an application for use by people sitting in their cars and wanting to make money by offering ride to other subscribers of the application. They get to meet somebody new and offer a possibly short ride with the incentive to pocket a taxi fee that the other person would have anyway expensed. Further this application allows user to make themselves available for very short amounts of time so they are not pinged when they are offline. This will be a phone based application that users can share their geographical location and should appear in say a 5 mile vicinity of other interested parties. The application will be based on the same technological stack as nerddinner example on the web with the differnce that this is a new way to get introduced to other people. The qualification criteria for subscribing to this application should be to post a picture of your car and yes the better car may get a better ride.
This is a win over applications such as taxi magic in that it lets people to offer their own car for a ride in order to make acquaintances and earn money.
